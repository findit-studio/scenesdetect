//! Integrated cascade detector: warm per-frame cut lanes → cheap
//! keyframe gates → expensive keyframe metrics, composed into one
//! sans-I/O state machine.
//!
//! # Workflow
//!
//! Per pushed frame, in order:
//!
//! 1. **Cut lanes** — every enabled lane runs warm on every frame at
//!    its standalone configuration and cuts directly: [`threshold`]
//!    (mean-luma fades), [`histogram`] over the luma plane, optional
//!    [`histogram`] instances over the hue and saturation planes (the
//!    chroma guards: transitions invisible to every luma-derived
//!    signal still shift the chroma distributions), [`phash`],
//!    [`content`], and [`adaptive`]. Direct histogram / phash cuts are
//!    attributed via [`Provenance::Histogram`] / [`Provenance::Phash`].
//! 2. **Contention** — reports contend on timestamp each push: the
//!    earliest admissible closes the shot, and strictly-later
//!    same-push losers are deferred to re-contend on later pushes (an
//!    [`adaptive`] verdict lags by its window, so same-push collisions
//!    are normal). The forced split ([`Options::max_scene_duration`])
//!    contends as the lowest-precedence candidate.
//! 3. **Keyframe selection (per window)** — every frame's metrics feed
//!    an internal [`select::Detector`]. Cheap metrics (luma mean /
//!    variance, saturation variance, clipping) run first; only frames
//!    passing the cheap gates pay for the expensive metrics (sharpness,
//!    noise, motion blur, colorfulness). The selector's buffer is
//!    drained one **window** at a time — the window equals
//!    [`target_interval`](select::Options::target_interval) (default
//!    1 s) — as each window closes or a cut confirms: the window's
//!    winner is emitted as a [`Event::Keyframe`] carrying
//!    [`Provenance::Quality`] (passed every strict gate) or
//!    [`Provenance::Fallback`] (least-bad pick). A consumer therefore
//!    caches only a small bounded span of frames, and keyframes associate to
//!    scenes by timestamp (a keyframe's scene is the [`Event::Scene`]
//!    whose range contains its timestamp).
//! 4. **The boundary keyframe** — opening a shot emits its first frame
//!    as a [`Event::Keyframe`] carrying [`Provenance::Boundary`],
//!    unconditionally. Being the cut is its qualification; the quality
//!    gates of step 3 judge only the interval picks that follow it. It
//!    is never selected twice — a boundary frame stays buffered past
//!    its own cut and would otherwise win the new shot's first window
//!    as well.
//!
//! Per-frame cost is every enabled lane's pass over the frame plus the
//! cheap keyframe metrics; the expensive keyframe metrics run only for
//! frames that pass the cheap gates.
//!
//! The lanes are pure signal generators: every lane runs with its
//! internal `min_duration` zeroed, and the machine owns all timeline
//! policy — per-lane spacing and warm-up applied via the machine's
//! admissibility gates — so a report the machine drops can never
//! advance a lane's private debounce anchor and shadow a later valid
//! cut. One documented trade-off: [`content::FilterMode::Merge`]
//! re-times flash runs via `min_duration`, and that re-timing is not
//! reproduced inside the cascade — the machine's spacing enforces the
//! same cut cadence without it.
//!
//! # Sans-I/O contract
//!
//! [`Detector::push`] is a pure state transition returning at most one
//! [`Event`]; the machine never blocks, spawns, or calls out.
//! [`Detector::finalize`] closes the open shot, returns every remaining
//! output in order, and refreshes all state for the next stream;
//! [`Detector::clear`] refreshes without emitting. One stream per
//! detector — multiplexing belongs to the caller, as does pairing
//! keyframe timestamps back to pixel data.
//!
//! Event invariants:
//!
//! - Every [`Event::Keyframe`] of a shot is delivered before that
//!   shot's [`Event::Scene`]: the window up to a confirming cut is
//!   finalized first, so its keyframes enter the queue ahead of the
//!   scene. Keyframe timestamps are strictly increasing within a shot.
//! - Every emitted shot has a FIRST keyframe: its
//!   [`Provenance::Boundary`] pick, at exactly the shot range's start.
//!   It is emitted the moment the shot opens — immediately after the
//!   preceding shot's [`Event::Scene`], and ahead of every keyframe
//!   the shot's own windows go on to select. It holds for a shot whose
//!   windows select nothing at all, and for the trailing shot that
//!   [`Detector::finalize`] closes. Two consequences a consumer may
//!   lean on: the boundary keyframe is index 0 of every shot's
//!   keyframe list, and no other keyframe ever shares its timestamp.
//!   End of stream opens no shot and so owes no boundary keyframe —
//!   nothing is ever emitted past the last frame.
//! - Keyframes associate to scenes by timestamp alone: a keyframe's
//!   scene is the [`Event::Scene`] whose half-open range contains its
//!   timestamp. This stays total even around lagged boundaries, where
//!   a keyframe surfacing near a boundary may belong to the *next*
//!   scene (with sparse pushes it can even be delivered before the
//!   *prior* scene's output; the partition keeps association total
//!   regardless of arrival order).
//! - Scene ranges are half-open `[start, end)`, all emitted in the
//!   stream's canonical timebase (the first frame's), with both
//!   endpoints ceiling-rescaled through the same function — so
//!   consecutive ranges stay exactly adjacent AND the emitted ranges
//!   tile the stream, keeping timestamp association total even under
//!   mixed-timebase pushes (a sub-tick scene collapses and is skipped;
//!   its keyframes parent to the neighboring range).
//! - The look-back / caching bound is **one window plus the adaptive
//!   lag horizon**: the selector holds about one
//!   [`target_interval`](select::Options::target_interval) of frames
//!   (a few more while an adaptive lane's lagged cut could still
//!   reclaim them), so a consumer pairing keyframe timestamps back to
//!   pixels caches only a small, bounded span.
//! - Emission of a closed window's winner (and of a lag-refined scene)
//!   happens on the call *after* the deciding frame: outputs describe
//!   earlier frames, never the future.
//! - The undelivered backlog is bounded: configurations that confirm
//!   boundaries faster than one output per push shed their OLDEST
//!   queued keyframes past a documented cap; scenes are never shed,
//!   and boundary keyframes only once no interval pick is left to
//!   shed instead.
//! - Concurrent boundary sources (the fade, lane reports, deferred
//!   survivors, the forced split) contend on timestamp each push: the
//!   earliest admissible closes, strictly-later losers re-contend on
//!   later pushes. The one residual: fade cuts from the terminal
//!   threshold lane interpolate between frames and may lag a fade's
//!   full length; such a cut never coincides with a pushed frame and
//!   timestamp association stays total, but a dark-stretch fallback
//!   pick near a long fade can end up attributed to the post-fade
//!   scene.
//!
//! # Trade-offs, stated plainly
//!
//! - A transition below every enabled lane's threshold is missed by
//!   design.
//! - Keyframes are selected per fixed-width window rather than over the
//!   whole (known-length) shot: a shot spanning several windows yields
//!   roughly one keyframe per window, and the per-shot adaptive
//!   sharpness floor never engages within a single short window (it
//!   falls back to the static
//!   [`min_sharpness`](select::Options::min_sharpness)). The trade is a
//!   bounded one-window caching cost against whole-shot optimality.
//! - Detectors here, as everywhere in this crate, expect downscaled
//!   analysis frames (the PySceneDetect 200–400 px convention).
